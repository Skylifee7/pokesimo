# Introduction

Welcome to the Otsimo's Pokemon API! You can use our API to access Pokemon API endpoints, which can get information about various pokemons, types, moves in a huge load of pokemon information database.

Currently our API is only accessible from Shell and therefore we have no language bindings(for now)! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and try it in your own shell.

This API created from the guys and gals from the [Otsimo](https://otsimo.com) with love!
Feel free to reach out.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

# Pokemon Types
